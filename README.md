# GraphAlgorithms
Implementation of common graph traversals/algorithms in Java. To solidify understanding of concepts taught in class. Note that emphasis here was not on optimal performance but rather replicating the pseudocode often used with these graph traversals / algorithms. In the future, I may revisit such implementations to match runtime performance as well as implementing others (e.g. PFS)

The following have been covered.

Single Source Shortest Path (SSSP):
- Dijkstra w/o PQ
- Bellman Ford (w/ negative weight cycle detection and printing)

All Source Shortest Path (APSP):
- Dijkstra
- Floyd (w/ Weighted Graph Properties)

Minimum Spanning Tree (MST):
- Prim
- Kruskal (w/ Sets joining)

Basic Traversals
- BFS w/o PQ (w/ Forest Printing)
- DFS w/o PQ (w/ Forest Printing)
- DFS w/o PQ (recursive & w/ Forest Printing)
- General Traversal

General
- Printing Adjacency Matrix Representation
- Printing Adjacency List Representation
