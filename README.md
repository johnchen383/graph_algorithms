# GraphAlgorithms
Implementation of common graph traversals/algorithms in Java

The following have been covered.

Single Source Shortest Path (SSSP):
- Dijkstra w/o PQ
- Bellman Ford (w/ negative weight cycle detection and printing)

All Source Shortest Path (APSP):
- Dijkstra
- Floyd (w/ Weighted Graph Properties)

Minimum Spanning Tree (MST):
- Prim
- Kruskal (w/ Sets joining)

Basic Traversals
- BFS w/o PQ

General
- Printing Adjacency Matrix Representation
- Printing Adjacency List Representation
